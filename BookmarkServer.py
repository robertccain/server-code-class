#
# A *bookmark server* or URI shortener that maintains a mapping (dictionary)
# between short names and long URIs, checking that each new URI added to the
# mapping actually works (i.e. returns a 200 OK).
#
# This server is intended to serve three kinds of requests:
#
#   * A GET request to the / (root) path.  The server returns a form allowing
#     the user to submit a new name/URI pairing.  The form also includes a
#     listing of all the known pairings.
#   * A POST request containing "longuri" and "shortname" fields.  The server
#     checks that the URI is valid (by requesting it), and if so, stores the
#     mapping from shortname to longuri in its dictionary.  The server then
#     redirects back to the root path.
#   * A GET request whose path contains a short name.  The server looks up
#     that short name in its dictionary and redirects to the corresponding
#     long URI.
#
# Your job in this exercise is to finish the server code.
#
# Here are the steps you need to complete:
#
# 1. Write the CheckURI function, which takes a URI and returns True if a
#    request to that URI returns a 200 OK, and False otherwise.
#
# 2. Write the code inside do_GET that sends a 303 redirect to a known name.
#
# 3. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 400 error if the form fields
#    are missing.
#
# 4. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 303 redirect to the form
#    after saving a newly submitted URI.
#
# 5. Write the code inside do_POST that sends a 404 error if a URI is not
#    successfully checked (i.e. if CheckURI returns false).
#
# In each step, you'll need to delete a line of code that raises the
# NotImplementedError exception.  These are there as placeholders in the
# starter code.
#
# After writing each step, restart the server and run test.py to test it.
